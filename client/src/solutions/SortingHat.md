## Bugs:
1. the **applyToHogwarts** doesn't work

## Main Issues:
1. component name doesn't match the name of the file 
1. create generic component for each form field 
1. create one state for the form 
1. map over the state's fields
1. correct html tags - use button instead of div with onClick, use mui
1. semicolons are important

* the if's check the same things, the thing they update repeat, use else
* the setResult repeat
* don't use any!
* arrow function at the render
* add types to the states

<!-- ## sorting-hat.css:
* do not use css files, only scss
* do not use img tag -->
