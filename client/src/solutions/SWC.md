## Main Issues:

1. wrong use of map, `lines 20-32, 24-30`
1. async function as map parameter, `lines 20-32, 25-29`
1. use Array.sort instead of sAB (sort function, `lines 56-70`), `line 43` and the function is in the file.

* component/file name - Star Wars Component initials
* bad variables names - use **F2**
* object[] as type, it is not specific enough, `line 24`
* { [key: string]: any }[] as type to state instead of building an interface, `line 17`
  (optional - explain here about **Record**)
